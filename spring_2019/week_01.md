## Last Week's Accomplishments


> This past week, I created my own github account and website. I also went through a tutorial on how to use Github.

## This Week's Plan


> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to learn how to make my own resume in HTML by reviewing othe resumes already coded. This will be a great way for me to get introduced to HTML.

## Anything Blocking?


> So far in my academic studies I have not had any experience working in Github and HTML. So it has been taking me extra time to learn the language and commands to keep up.
